*****************************
Connecting for the first time
*****************************

All connections to OLCF resources are done via Secure Shell (ssh). SSH encrypts
the entire session between the user connecting and the OLCF systems and avoids
risks associated with using plain-text communication.

.. note:: To access OLCF systems, your SSH client must support SSH protocol
    version 2 (this is common) and allow keyboard-interactive authentication.


For UNIX-based SSH clients, the following line should be in either the default
``ssh_config`` file or your ``$HOME/.ssh/config`` file:

::

   PreferredAuthentications keyboard-interactive,password


The line may also contain other authentication methods but
``keyboard-interactive`` must be included.

SSH clients are available for Windows-based systems, such as `SecureCRT
<https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/>`_ published by VanDyke software.
For recent SecureCRT versions, the preferred authentication setting shown above
can be made through the "connection properties" menu.

.. note::
    SSH multiplexing is disabled on all of the OLCF’s user-facing systems.
    Users will receive an error message if they attempt to connect to an OLCF
    resource that tries to reuse an SSH control path. To ensure SSH connections will
    not attempt multiplexing, you will need to modify your ``$HOME/.ssh/config``
    file by adding the following:
    ::

        Host *.ccs.ornl.gov
          ControlMaster no

With an active user account, you'll be able to log into any of the
systems allocated to your project(s). All OLCF resources (except the Ascent
training system) require two-factor authentication. This means you will need an
OLCF-provided RSA SecurID fob to log into any of the systems.

*****************************
Activating a new SecurID fob
*****************************
.. image:: /images/rsa_securid_fob.gif
   :align: center

#. Initiate a SSH connection to ``username@home.ccs.ornl.gov``.
#. When prompted for a PASSCODE, enter the 6-digit code shown on the
   fob.
#. You will be asked if you are ready to set your PIN. Answer with "Y".
#. You will be prompted to enter a PIN. Enter a (4) to (6) digit number
   you can remember. You will then be prompted to re-enter your PIN.
#. Allow the 6-digit code to change (codes regenerate every 30 seconds).
   Once the (6) digits on your fob change, enter your PIN followed by
   the new (6) digits displayed on the fob.
#. Your PIN is now set, and your fob is activated for login to other
   OLCF systems.

Once activated, the RSA SecurID fob can be used to access OLCF systems.
When initiating a SSH connection to a system, you will be prompted to
enter your PASSCODE. Simply enter your PIN followed by the (6) digit
code shown on your SecurID fob and press enter. For example, if your pin
is ``1234`` and the (6) digits on the fob are ``000987``, you would
enter ``1234000987`` when prompted for a PASSCODE.

.. note::
    The 6-digit code displayed on the SecurID fob can only be used
    once. If prompted for multiple PASSCODE entries, always allow the code to
    change between attempts. Re-using a code can cause your account to be
    automatically locked.


********************************
PINs, Passcodes, and Tokencodes
********************************

When users connect with RSA SecurID tokens, they are most often prompted for a
PASSCODE. Sometimes, they are instead prompted for a PIN (typically only on
initial setup) and other times they might be prompted to wait for the tokencode
to change and enter the new tokencode. What do these terms mean?

The ``TOKENCODE`` is the 6-digit number generated by the RSA token.

The ``PIN`` is a (4) to (8)-digit number selected by the user when they
initially set up their RSA token.

The ``PASSCODE`` is simply the user’s PIN followed by the current tokencode.

These are relatively straightforward; however, there can be some confusion on
initial setup. The first time a user connects with a new token (or, if for some
reason the user requested that we clear the PIN associated with their token)
they are prompted for a PASSCODE but in reality only enter a tokencode. This is
because during this initial setup procedure a PIN does not exist. Since there is
no PIN, the PASSCODE is the same as the tokencode in this rare case.

***************
X11 Forwarding
***************

Automatic forwarding of the X11 display to a remote computer is possible with
the use of SSH and a local (e.g. on your desktop) X server. To set up automatic
X11 forwarding within SSH, you can do one of the following:

1) Invoke ssh on the command line with:
::

	$ ssh -X hostname

Note that use of the -x option (lowercase) will **disable** X11 forwarding.

2) Edit (or create) your ``$HOME/.ssh/config`` file to include the following line:
::

	ForwardX11 yes

All X11 data will go through an encrypted channel. The ``$DISPLAY`` environment
variable set by SSH will point to the remote machine with a port number greater
than zero. This is normal, and happens because SSH creates a proxy X server on
the remote machine for forwarding the connections over an encrypted channel. The
connection to the real X server will be made from the local machine.

.. warning::
    Users should not manually set the ``$DISPLAY`` environment variable for X11
    forwarding; a non-encrypted channel may be used in this case.

Occassionally, you may receive an error message upon logging in to a system such
as the following:
::

	@@ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @@
	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
	Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
	It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.

This can be a result of normal system maintenance that results in a changed RSA
public key, or could be an actual security incident.  If the RSA fingerprint
displayed by your SSH client does not match the OLCF-authorized RSA fingerprint
(shown in the table above) for the machine you are accessing, do not continue
authentication; instead, contact help@olcf.ornl.gov.
