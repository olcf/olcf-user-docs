Forms for Requesting an Account
===============================

`Request an Account <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/for-users/documents-forms/olcf-account-application/>`_
Use this form to request a new user account or join an additional project.

`Notary Token Verification
Form <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/accounts/Notary_Token_Verification_Form.pdf>`_ (See
`Notary Instructions <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/accounts/Notary_Instructions.pdf>`__)
For certain resources, ORNL requires identity proofing to authenticate a
user’s identity and possession of the token prior to activation. The
Notary Token Verification Form verifies the identity of the applicant
and maintains records of the identity proofing credentials that may be
disclosed in the future to an authorized individual or investigative
agency.

`Nondisclosure Agreement
Form <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/accounts/OLCF_NDA.pdf>`_ Required from
subcontractors only.

`Sensitive Data Rules <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/accounts/Sensitive_Data_Rules.pdf>`_

Forms to Request Changes to Computers, Jobs, or Accounts
========================================================

`Software Installation Request
Form <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/support/software/software-request>`_
Use this form to request
a software/library/application installation on a center computer.

`Relaxed Queue Limit Request
Form <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/user-support-overview/getting-started/special-request-form/>`_
Use this form to request deviations from the standard batch queue
policy. Typical requests would be for increased priority for one (or
several) jobs or an increased wall-time limit.

`System Reservation Request
Form <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/user-support-overview/getting-started/special-request-form/>`_
Use this form to request dedicated access to some or all of a machine.
If granted, no other users/projects will be running on the processors
that have been reserved. Please note that if granted, your project will
be charged for the entire dedicated time and not just the time used by
your jobs. Thus, a reservation for 100 nodes on Titan for 48 hours will
result in a charge of 144,000 core-hours (100 nodes × 30 "cores" per
node x 48 hours). A reservation differs from increased priority requests
and increased wall-time requests in that those requests must still wait
in the batch queue. A reservation sets aside a set of processors for a
user (or group of users) with a definite start and end time.
Additionally, the reservation differs from traditional batch jobs in the
way it is charged against an allocation (described above).

`Disk Quota Increase Request
Form <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/user-support-overview/getting-started/special-request-form/>`_
Use this form to request an increased disk quota.

`Purge Exemption Request
Form <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/user-support-overview/getting-started/special-request-form/>`_
Use this form to request temporary relief from the scratch disk purge.
