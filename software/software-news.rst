Frontier: hardware counter daemon (July 29, 2025)
------------------------------------------------

On July 29, 2025, a ROCm Profiler (``rocprofiler``) based daemon that automatically samples GPU hardware counters from a subset of compute nodes will be enabled by default for all jobs > 1800 nodes.
This can be explicitly enabled/disabled via the ``--gpu-counters`` flag to ``sbatch``.
To explicitly enable the rocprofiler-based counter collection daemon, set ``--gpu-counters=1``.
To explicitly disable to daemon, set ``--gpu-counters=0``.
See :ref:`frontier-slurm-plugins` for more information.


Frontier: Core Module (March 18, 2025)
------------------------------------------------

On March 18, 2025, a new version of the ``Core`` module, ``Core/25.03``, was provided on Frontier. Note that the default ``Core`` remains ``Core/24.07`` at this time.

----------------------------------------------------

The Frontier system was upgraded to a new version of the system software stack.

.. warning:: **Codes should be rebuilt** prior to running following the upgrade due to the OS and software changes.

As part of this upgrade, the libfabric/1.15.2.0 module has also be removed, as a new libfabric version, 1.22.0, is available.
Version 1.20.1 is retained, as libfabric/1.22.0 is not compatible with cray-mpich modules prior to 8.1.28.

Please see the `Frontier System Updates post <https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/frontier_user_guide.html#id17>`_ for further information about this upgrade.

Frontier: System Software Update (July 16, 2024)
------------------------------------------------

The Frontier system will be upgraded to a new version of the system software stack.  

.. warning:: **Codes should be rebuilt** prior to running following the upgrade due to the OS and software changes.

As a result of the upgrade, the following packages are now default:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Package", "Previous Default", "New Default"

    "ROCm", "5.3.0", "5.7.1"
    "HPE/Cray Programming Environment (CPE)", "22.12", "23.12"
    "Cray Compiler Environment (CCE)", "15.0.0", "17.0.0"
    "GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)", "12.2.0", "12.3.0"
    "AMD Compiler (AMD)", "5.3.0", "5.7.1"

In addition to the default modules changing, the layout of the modules for the OLCF provided software stack will change.
Going forward our core software (i.e., software independent of compiler type/version) will be in a default module
called ``Core`` with the version being in the format `year/month`. Additionally explicit suffixes have been added to modules to indicate MPI, OpenMP, and GPU support. 
All modules that depend on ROCm are suffixed with ``-gpu``. The same is true for packages with mpi ``-mpi`` and
openmp ``-omp``. Software is built to target CPE releases based on compiler (e.g., cce, amd, or gcc), cray-mpich, and ROCm versions.
If you have an :ref:`unsupported combination <understanding-the-compatibility-of-compilers-rocm-and-cray-mpich>` of those modules you may not see certain parts of the normal software stack.

Please contact help@olcf.ornl.gov if you encounter any issues or have questions.

If you are using python from one of the modulefiles rather than the version in */usr/bin*, this change should not affect how you invoke python in your scripts, although we encourage specifying *python2* or *python3* as a best practice.

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Summit: Software Installation/Default Software Changes (August 17-19, 2021)</b></p>

Summit's operating system will be upgraded to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL 8) on August 17-19, 2021.  

.. warning:: **Codes should be rebuilt** prior to running following the upgrade due to the OS and software changes.

As a result of the upgrade, the following new packages will become available:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Package", "Current Default", "New Default"

    "CUDA Toolkit", "10.1.243", "11.0.3"

    "IBM XL", "16.1.1-5", "16.1.1-10"
    "IBM ESSL", "6.1.0-2", "6.3.0"

.. note::  The **OS-provided Python will no longer be accessible as python** (including variations like */usr/bin/python* or */usr/bin/env python*); rather, you must specify it as *python2* or *python3*. If you are using python from one of the modulefiles rather than the version in */usr/bin*, this change should not affect how you invoke python in your scripts, although we encourage specifying *python2* or *python3* as a best practice.

In addition, the following packages will be upgraded to newer versions and the specific versions listed below will be removed from the system. If you need any of the specific versions scheduled to be removed, please contact help@olcf.ornl.gov.

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>All Systems: Python2 End of Life (January 01, 2020)</b></p>

On January 1, 2020, Python 2 will reach its end of life and will no longer be
supported by the project’s core developers. On this date, the OLCF will also
end its support for Python 2. Users reliant on Python 2 should port code to
Python 3 for forward compatibility with OLCF systems and many open source
packages. Python 2 modules will not be removed on January 1, but will no longer
receive maintenance or regular updates.

While default Python modules on OLCF systems are already set to Python 3, we
recommend all users follow PEP394 by explicitly invoking either ‘python2’ or
‘python3’ instead of simply ‘python’. Python 2 Conda Environments and user
installations of Python 2 will remain as options for using Python 2 on OLCF
systems.

Official documentation for porting from Python 2 to Python3 can be found at:
`<https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html>`_

Python 2 can be found at: `<https://python3statement.org/>`_
