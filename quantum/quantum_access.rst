********************************************
Quantum Computing User Program (QCUP) Access
********************************************

Welcome! The information below introduces how we structure projects and user
accounts for access to the Quantum resources within the QCUP program. In
general, OLCF QCUP resources are granted to projects, which are in turn made
available to the approved users associated with each project. 

To gain access, you must first submit a project proposal to the OLCF QCUP 
(see :ref:`quantum-proj`) or join an existing QCUP project (see :ref:`quantum-user`).
The Quantum Resource Utilization Council (QRUC), as well as independent
referees, review and approve all QCUP project proposals.  Applications to QCUP
are accepted year-round via the project application form found below. Once a
project is approved, then all of the users associated with the project will
need to apply for a :ref:`User Account <quantum-user>`. After your user account
is approved, you can then move on to accessing the quantum resources offered by
our vendors (see :ref:`quantum-vendors`).

QCUP Priorities
===============

There are several broad aims of the Quantum Computing User Program at OLCF, which are as follows:

1. **Enable Research**

  The QCUP aims to provide a broad spectrum of user access to the best
  available quantum computing systems. Once a user’s intended research has been
  reviewed for merit and user agreements have been established, we seek to
  provide users with the opportunity to become familiar with the unique aspects
  and challenges of quantum computing, as well as to implement and test quantum
  algorithms on the available systems.

2. **Evaluate Technology**

  The QCUP aims to aid in the evaluation of technology by monitoring the
  breadth and performance of early quantum computing applications. How users
  integrate quantum computing with scientific computing is a question constrained
  by both application, infrastructure constraints, and the use cases expected for
  the associated computational system. Through the QCUP program, users can
  explore new potential computational research applications, and potentially
  accelerate existing scientific applications using quantum processors and
  architectures. Research projects supported include advanced scientific
  computing, basic energy science, biological environmental research, high-energy
  physics, fusion energy science, and nuclear physics, among others.

3. **Engage the Community**

  The QCUP aims to engage the quantum computing community and support the
  growth of the quantum information science ecosystems. Our quantum computing
  users range in quantum computing experience from novice to expert; users are
  from US national labs, universities, government, and industry.  User groups
  utilize quantum computing expertise to investigate diverse application
  interests, using multiple programming languages, quantum-classical programming,
  and multiple software environments. Most projects focus on proof-of-principle
  demonstrations and/or new method development. Some projects focus on
  application performance and/or benchmarking, and additionally some projects
  focus on device characterization, verification, and validation.

.. _quantum-proj:

Project Allocations
===================

A QCUP proposal describes the nature, methodology, and merits of the project,
explains why it requires access to QCUP resources, and outlines any other
essential information that might be needed for its consideration. Project
applications are submitted using the `Project Application Form
<https://my.olcf.ornl.gov/project-application-new>`__. Select "OLCF Quantum
Computing User Program" from the dropdown menu.

For QCUP Projects, all proposed work must be open, fundamental research and no
Export Control, PHI, or other controlled data can be used. 

Once submitted, you will receive email notification of successful proposal
submission.  The proposal is then reviewed by the Quantum Resource Utilization
Council (QRUC), as well as independent referees for merit and to ensure the
feasibility of project success using the resources available to the QCUP. You
will be notified of the QRUC decision via email. 

What happens after a project request is approved?
-------------------------------------------------

Once a project request is approved by the QRUC, an OLCF Accounts Manager will
communicate with the project’s PI to finalize activation and request a signed
Principal Investigator’s PI Agreement to be submitted.

The OLCF will then establish a QCUP project and notify the PI of its creation
along with the 6-character OLCF QCUP Project ID and resources allocation
details. At this time project participants may proceed with applying for their
individual user accounts. 

After a project is approved, a PI can then ask for specific allocation amounts
following the :ref:`quantum-req` instructions.

.. _quantum-req:

Credit Allocation Requests
--------------------------

Running jobs on quantum hardware through QCUP requires vendor-specific credits
or time-based allocation, depending on the system. To ensure the efficient use
of resources, the following allocation policy is in effect:

* All credit or time requests must be submitted by the project's Principal
  Investigator (PI). Requests can be made through the Quantum Allocation
  Request form available under the "Allocations" section in `myOLCF <https://my.olcf.ornl.gov/login>`__ (select your
  QCUP project under "My Projects" after login). Alternatively, you may submit
  a request via the OLCF Help Ticket System at help@olcf.ornl.gov.

* Requests must include a technical justification that demonstrates an
  understanding of the resource requirements for the proposed quantum workload.
  Users must simulate their workloads using the appropriate simulator,
  emulator, or resource estimation tools provided by the vendor to estimate
  circuit depth, qubit usage, execution time, and other relevant metrics.

* Below are links to each vendor-specific instructions and policies:

  * :ref:`IBM Allocation Instructions <ibm-alloc>`
  * :ref:`Quantinuum Allocation Instructions <quantinuum-alloc>`
  * :ref:`IonQ Allocation Instructions <ionq-alloc>`
  * :ref:`IQM Allocation Instructions <iqm-alloc>`

For questions or assistance with preparing a request, contact help@olcf.ornl.gov.

Project Renewals 
----------------

QCUP Projects have a finite duration; when starting, projects get however many
months are left in that allocation period and then must be renewed for
subsequent 6 month intervals. Projects can be renewed by filling out a renewal
form (:download:`Accounts Renewal Form <Quantum-Renewal-Form.docx>`) and
emailing it to accounts@ccs.ornl.gov.

Closeout and Quarterly Reports
------------------------------

All QCUP projects are required to submit 
`quarterly reports <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/industry_quarterly_report.doc>`__ and a
`closeout report <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/Closeout_Template.doc>`__.
These forms may be emailed to accounts@ccs.ornl.gov.

.. _quantum-user:

User Accounts
=============

Any collaborator involved with an approved and activated OLCF project can apply
for a user account associated with that project to gain access. 

.. note::
    Project PIs do not receive a user account with project
    creation, and must also apply.

#. First-time users should apply for an account using the `Account Request
   Form <https://my.olcf.ornl.gov/account-application-new>`__. You will need the correct
   6 character project ID from your PI. 
#. When our accounts team begins processing your application, you will receive an automated
   email containing a unique 36-character confirmation code. Make note of it; you can use
   it to check the status of your application at any time.
#. The principal investigator (PI) of the project must approve your
   account and system access. We will make the project PI aware of your request.
#. Once your application is evaluated and approved, you will be notified via email of your account 
   creation, and the quantum resource vendor will be contacted with instructions to grant you access.

Checking the status of your application
---------------------------------------

You can check the general status of your application at any time using the
myOLCF self-service portal's `account status page <https://my.olcf.ornl.gov/pending/status>`__.
For more information, see our :doc:`myOLCF Overview </services_and_applications/myolcf/overview>` page. 
If you need to make further inquiries about your application, you may email our
Accounts Team at accounts@ccs.ornl.gov.

When all of the above steps are completed, your user account will be created
and you will be notified by email. Now that you have a user account and it has
been associated with a project, you're ready to get to work. 

.. _quantum-vendors:

Accessing Quantum Resources
===========================

As opposed to setting up a personal account through each of the individual
vendor websites, OLCF has purchased subscriptions to those vendor services and
handles setting up your access to each one once your Quantum User Application
is approved. You will receive individual email invitations from Quantinuum
with further instructions, whereas for IBM you can proceed directly to
their website to create an account. More details for gaining access to each
vendor are listed below.

For details on how to use a vendor's system once access is gained, see our :doc:`Quantum Systems Guides </quantum/quantum_systems/index>` instead.

Example Python scripts for each QCUP vendor are located at our new :doc:`/quantum/hello_qcup` page.

IBM Quantum Computing
---------------------
.. note::
   Beginning July 1, IBM's Quantum Cloud Platform allocates QPU resources by region. OLCF users will
   be granted access to the QPU's Washington DC (us-east) region, however, if you would like access to
   the QPU's in the Frankfurt (eu-de) region, please include this in your request.

After submitting the OLCF quantum account application and receiving approval, create an IBMid at `<https://login.ibm.com/>`__.
Use your IBMid to login to your IBM Cloud Account by proceeding to `<https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/signin>`__, 
enter your IBMid email which will be the email associated with your OLCF account,
leave the region selected as "Washington DC (us-east)", and press continue. 
If sign-in fails or if you're asked for credit card information, contact help@olcf.ornl.gov. Once logged
in, users will have access to the IBM Quantum Cloud Platform, IBM’s online platform for
QPU access, viewing allocation details, accessing documention, etc. More information about using
these IBM quantum resources can be found on the `IBM's Documentation <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/>`__
