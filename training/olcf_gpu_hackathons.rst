OLCF GPU Hackathons
===================

Each year, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) works with our
vendor partners to organize a series of GPU hackathons at a number of host
locations around the world. The table below lists the OLCF-supported events
scheduled for 2020.

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>What is a GPU hackathon?</b></p>

A GPU hackathon is a multi-day coding event in which teams of developers port their
own applications to run on GPUs, or optimize their applications that already
run on GPUs. Each team consists of 3 or more developers who are intimately
familiar with (some part of) their application, and they work alongside 1 or
more mentors with GPU programming expertise. Our mentors come from
universities, national laboratories, supercomputing centers, and industry
partners. 

.. note::
   There are a variety of programming models available to program GPUs (e.g. CUDA, OpenACC, OpenMP offloading, etc.) and your are welcome to use any of them at these events.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Why participate?</b></p>

If you want/need to get your code running (or optimized) on a GPU-accelerated
system, these hackathons offer a unique opportunity to set aside 5 days,
surrounds yourself with experts in the field, and push toward your development
goals. By the end of the event, each team should have part of their code running 
(or more optimized) on GPUs, or at least have a clear roadmap of how to get there.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Target audience</b></p>

We are looking for teams of 3-6 developers with a scalable** application to
port (or optimize on) GPUs. Collectively, the team should know the application
intimately. 

[** We say scalable here because we're typically looking for codes intended to
run on multiple nodes (e.g. MPI-enabled), although porting/optimizing such
codes on a single node during the events is encouraged whenever possible.]

.. note::
   Please keep in mind that we are looking for teams with plans to develop GPU code - not to simply run their code on GPUs.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Virtual hackathon format</b></p>

Typically, these hackathons are in-person events, where each team (app
developers + mentors) sits at their own round table in a single large
conference room. This structure allows teams to hack away on their own codes,
but also to interact (ask questions, give advice, etc.) with members/mentors
from other teams when needed.

To recreate this environment in a virtual setting, we will be using Zoom +
Slack. Zoom will be used as the main online tool due to its breakout room
capabilities; there will be a single Zoom session, where the main room will be
used for presentations, and breakout rooms will be used by individual teams
(for screen sharing and verbal communication). We will also set up a Slack
workspace for communication between all participants, and individual team
channels for communication within teams (chat, sharing code snippets, etc.).

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Ok, so how do I attend?</b></p>

First, you must decide which event you'd like to attend (see table of events
above for locations and proposal deadlines), and then submit a short proposal
form describing your application and team. The organizing committee will then
review all proposals after the call for that event closes and select the teams
they believe are best suited for the event. 

To submit a proposal, please visit `gpuhackathons.org/events
<https://gpuhackathons.org/events>`__, click on the event you'd like to attend,
and submit the form.

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Costs?</b></p>

Events are free for the selected participants. The organizers will provide a
meeting room, lunches, mentors, and access to compute resources.
