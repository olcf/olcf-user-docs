===================
OLCF GPU Hackathons
===================

Each year, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) works with our vendor partners to organize a series of GPU hackathons at a number of host
locations around the world.

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>What is a GPU hackathon?</b></p>

A GPU hackathon is a multi-day coding event in which teams of developers port their own applications to run on GPUs, or optimize their applications that already
run on GPUs. Each team consists of 3 or more developers who are intimately familiar with (some part of) their application, and they work alongside 1 or
more mentors with GPU programming expertise. Our mentors come from universities, national laboratories, supercomputing centers, and industry partners. 

.. note::
   There are a variety of programming models available to program GPUs (e.g. CUDA, OpenACC, OpenMP offloading, etc.) and your are welcome to use any of them at these events.

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Why participate?</b></p>

If you want/need to get your code running (or optimized) on a GPU-accelerated system, these hackathons offer a unique opportunity to set aside the time, surround yourself with experts in the field, and push toward your development goals. By the end of the event, each team should have part of their code running (or more optimized) on GPUs, or at least have a clear roadmap of how to get there.

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Target audience</b></p>

We are looking for teams of 3-6 developers with a scalable** application to port (or optimize on) GPUs. Collectively, the team should know the application
intimately. 

.. note::
    ** We say scalable here because we're typically looking for codes intended to run on multiple nodes (e.g. MPI-enabled), although porting/optimizing such codes on a single node during the events is encouraged whenever possible.

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Virtual hackathon format</b></p>

Typically, these hackathons are in-person events, where each team (app developers + mentors) sits at their own round table in a single large conference room. This structure allows teams to hack away on their own codes, but also to interact (ask questions, give advice, etc.) with members/mentors from other teams when needed.

To recreate this environment in a virtual setting, we will be using Zoom + Slack. Zoom will be used as the main online tool due to its breakout room capabilities; there will be a single Zoom session, where the main room will be used for presentations, and breakout rooms will be used by individual teams (for screen sharing and verbal communication). We will also set up a Slack workspace for communication between all participants, and individual team channels for communication within teams (chat, sharing code snippets, etc.).

   <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Ok, so how do I attend?</b></p>

First, you must decide which event you'd like to attend (use link below to find a hackathon whose dates make sense for your team), and then submit a short proposal form describing your application and team. The organizing committee will then review all proposals after the call for that event closes and select the teams they believe are best suited for the event. 

Please visit `gpuhackathons.org/events <https://gpuhackathons.org/events>`__ to see the current list of events (new ones added throughout the year) and their proposal deadlines. To submit a proposal, click on the event you'd like to attend and submit the form.


.. note::
     The OLCF-supported events are a subset of a larger number of GPU hackathons organized around the world. Look for hackathons with the OLCF logo to find events supported by OLCF.
